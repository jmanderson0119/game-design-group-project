This folder is dedicated to all C# scripting, prefabs, and canvas related to the player character in this project. It includes behavior for the player's movement, abilities, GUI in the levels, cooldowns, and projectiles.

While I am the author of this directory, I did not write the DisplayReward.cs file and there are bits and pieces here and there that appear to be shoved into my files... Would've been nice if they were at least documented for easy reading
